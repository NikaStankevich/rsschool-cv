I started my career as a project manager in large mobile retailer after graduating university. I was involved in creating new services and possibilities for clients.

Then I got a job as a project manager, and later - as a director, in a contact center and worked there for 3 years. 

Later I changed sphere and become project manager in consulting company that developув service and maintenance. 

In 2017,  after the birth of the second daughter, I decided to leave office work and  took up photography.  I have my own specific photography studio.
